A dynamic Android news aggregator that delivers headlines searchable by keyword, category, and source.

*   **Technologies:** Kotlin, RESTful API, Jetpack Compose, SharedPreferences, Google Maps SDK
*   **Features:**
    *   Utilizes the NewsAPI.org RESTful API for real-time news aggregation.
    *   Modern, multi-activity UI built with Jetpack Compose.
    *   Persists user data and preferences with SharedPreferences.
    *   Integrates Google Maps SDK for location-based news discovery.
    *   Implements a custom paging system for efficient loading of extensive article lists.

### 🏫 University Application, Registration, and Advising Fullstack Application

Developed an end-to-end system managing the student lifecycle from application through registration to alumni status.

*   **Technologies:** Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS
*   **Features:**
    *   Manages applicant status, course registration, academic advising, and alumni tracking.
    *   Robust backend logic developed with Python.
    *   Utilizes MySQL for efficient relational database management.
    *   Designed and implemented comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for various user roles.
    *   Enhanced user interface to support diverse user interactions and system navigation.

⚙️ RISC-V CPU Emulator & Simulator

A comprehensive, multi-phase project to build a functional emulator for the RISC-V (RV64I) instruction set architecture from the ground up in C. This emulator can parse assembly programs, execute instructions, manage memory, and simulate cache performance.

*    **Technologies:** C, RISC-V Assembly
*    **Features:**
  
        Phase 1 (Instruction Parser): Developed a robust instruction parser to read textual RISC-V assembly programs and translate them into executable in-memory data structures.

        Phase 2 (Register Machine): Implemented the CPU's register file and emulated the full set of register-to-register and immediate arithmetic/logical operations (e.g., add, addi, sll, xor).

        Phase 3 (Memory & Storage): Built a memory module to handle storage instructions, accurately simulating byte, half-word, word, and double-word loads and stores (lb, sw, ld, etc.) with proper sign extension.

        Phase 4 (Control Flow): Engineered the control flow logic, enabling the emulator to execute conditional branches (beq, bne), unconditional jumps (jal), and function call/return mechanics (jalr).

        Phase 5 (Cache Simulation): Integrated a direct-mapped cache simulator to track and report on memory access patterns, calculating cache hits, misses, and evictions to analyze program performance.

### 📈 Covid-19 Twitter Data Analysis

A Java-based data analysis tool designed to process and visualize COVID-19 trends from large Twitter datasets.

*   **Technologies:** Java, Pandas (if you used a Java equivalent or for data prep), potentially Matplotlib (for visualization, if generated via Java).
*   **Features:**
    *   Extracts sentiment trends related to the pandemic from Twitter data.
    *   Identifies and visualizes keyword frequencies to understand public discourse.
    *   Provides insights into public perception and discussion surrounding COVID-19.
